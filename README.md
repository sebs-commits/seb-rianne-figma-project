# seb-rianne-figma-project
Practicing HTML and CSS
In this project the main focus will be to recreate my friends figma prototype into HTML and CSS.
Another thing I will try to focus on in this project is to learn more about creating a more responsive and compatible design using CSS.
Will reformat and practice using flexbox.
